# DSA with Python

## About
**Data Structure and Algorithm with Python** 

This repository has an implementation of the algorithms and data structures with Python. I made this repository for fun and it started while I solved the *lletcode* problems and I thought it was going to be helpful for others, especially students.

All of the algorithms and data structures have a test, and I wrote tests with *pytest*.

## Challenges / Problems
As I said, I started the repository while solving the *Leetcode and Hackerrank* problems/challenges, so I pushed some of the problems I solved on these websites. So that you can find these in [problems](https://github.com/mohammadpagard/python-algorithm/tree/main/problems) .
